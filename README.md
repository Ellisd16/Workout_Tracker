# Workout_Tracker

## About

Develop an application that can track a user's workouts, add workouts, and see statistics of said workouts. The application must utilize the mongodb database.

## Developement

For this app, I utilized Javascript, Node.js, and Mongodb to create a database that could house data. Within the routes files, I established the routes that the application would run on and make api calls from. 

## Problems

The app runs perfectly fine on localhost, but the database is having trouble connecting through Heroku. I believe this is a verification problem, and I will update it as soon as possible
